  <h1>Why This Matters</h1>
  <p>
    Cancer screening is a method that not only allows for detection of cancer, but it also is a prevention tactic.
    Many people miss opportunities for early detection due to lack of awareness. Screening is often free or covered
    by insurance, and early detection can save lives.
